# About
This project presents an affordable, real-time multispectral imaging (MSI) system designed to enhance tissue analysis in pathology applications. We modified a standard brightfield microscope by integrating an individually addressable LED matrix, a single board computer (SBC), and a machine vision (MV) camera, enabling automated multispectral image acquisition and on-chip preprocessing. Spectral unmixing is performed onboard using a Vertex Component Analysis (VCA)-based blind unmixing algorithm, providing unique spectral signatures of target molecules in histopathology samples without relying on additional computational resources.

For ovarian granulosa cell tumor (GCT) classification, support vector machine (SVM) models trained on MS images achieved an accuracy of 0.94, significantly outperforming models trained only on traditional brightfield images (accuracy of 0.62). This demonstrates the superior tissue discrimination and diagnostic potential of MS imaging.

Our solution is cost-effective and aimed at improving precision in tissue identification by capturing and analyzing information across multiple visible wavelengths. The system is well-suited for real-time applications in rural or resource-limited healthcare settings, widening access to advanced pathological diagnostics at the point of care.
